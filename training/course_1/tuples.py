# Exercise: Tuples
# Date: 29 Aug 2021

# a type of data structure... container that can store different values
# similar to a list but key differences

# co-ordinates, immutable cannot be changed or modified any elements within the tuple

coordinates = (4, 5)
coordinates = [ (4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)]   # tuples within side a list
print(coordinates[1], "Printing tuple at index 1 within a list")
print("key difference between tuple vs list is a tuple is immutable and a list is not")


# a list uses square brackets vs tuple curve bracket parenthesis
# store data that will not change e.g cooridnate
